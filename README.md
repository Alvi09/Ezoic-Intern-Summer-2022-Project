# Ezoic-Intern-Summer-2022-Project

## Assumptions
 - Simple local, networking protocol communication through sockets 

## Approach
 - Setup server first so clients to connect by listening
 - Connect clients to server to allow socket communication
 - < Create more advanced features once implemention done (probably like kicking users? or setup a password system) >

## Libraries used
 - imported socket to handle communication between sockerts
 - imported threading to handle multi-threading to allow clients executing independently
 - imported sys

## Decisions and tradeoffs 
 - OOP vs Procedural Programming
   - For this project, I took on a more procedural path since the server and client code didn't need to be reused or shared for other programs

## If it were a bigger project 
 - < Do afterwards >
