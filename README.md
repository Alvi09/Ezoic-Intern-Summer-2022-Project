# Ezoic-Intern-Summer-2022-Project

# Assumptions
 - Simple local, networking protocol communication through sockets 

# Approach
 - Setup server first so clients to connect by listening
 - Connect clients to server to allow socket communication
 - < Create more advanced features once implemention done (probably like kicking users? or setup a password system) >

# Libraries used
 - Python's socket

# Decisions and tradeoffs 
 - < Add here > 

# If it were a bigger project 
 - < Do afterwards >
